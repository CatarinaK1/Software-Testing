# Software-Testing

This repository is a collection of exercises completed as part of my Software Testing course. 

We've used Python's built-in `unittest` library to demonstrate various unit testing scenarios. To run these tests, make sure you have Python installed. 

## Python Unit Testing:

    Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/).

    unittest Module: Python's unittest module is the built-in testing framework. It does not require a separate installation because it comes with Python.

## Robot Framework:
    
    You need to install Robot Framework, which is an open-source test automation framework. To install the Robot framework run the command:
    `pip install robotframework`

   ### Robot Framework for the database testing:
    `pip install â€“U robotframework-databaselibrary`
    `pip install pymysql`

   ### SeleniumLibrary For Web Testing with Robot Framework:
    Running this command installs the latest Selenium and Robot Framework versions, but you still need to install browser drivers separately. The --upgrade option can be omitted when installing the library for the first time.
    `pip install --upgrade robotframework-seleniumlibrary`
    `pip install webdrivermanager`

  ### Webdriver
